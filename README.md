# JS-Sambahsapronunciator

This script gives you the phonetic transcription of Sambahsa words in both IPA (_International Phonetic Alphabet_) and SPT (_Sambahsa Phonetic Transcription_).

For testing the script, I provide you an HTML page, but you can easily embed the script in your website, just follow the instructions of the `main.html` file and/or just read the source-code of this HTML file.
